#Question 1
#a)
find the value of PM10 measurements in a day and store it 
in a list called daily_value
So to find the average daily_value you loop the list and add every
value in the list and then divide by 24 store it in another list 
called avg_daily_value and you loop it everyday


then in the avg_daily_value compare the correct day and see if the
value of that specific day is over 50 micrograms per cubic metre
and see if it is over 50 

in total you loop the avg_daily_value 365 times to get a year
then you loop the avg_daily_value to get the total called
total_avg_daily_value then you divide it by 365 to get the daily
value averaged across the year 

#b)
the output results that are collected hourly can use to see in which
specific hour has the value lowered or spiked. It can be used to 
observe if in a certain hour the value has exceed 50 or not and
can be used in the end-of-year report and publish it to the local press
to see which part of day is the busiest 

#c)

#i)
When is the time producing the most eg:rush hour or not 
and when is it not producing
#ii)
the town can plan it like eg: when it is producing the most the
govt can control it by shutting down certain factories so it can 
balance out

#d)
The town can do it through trial and error first by comparing the 
avg_daily_value of a no car weekend to a yes car weekend then the
can narrow it down starting by 10 cars, 20 cars and so on 
and until the point when the avg_daily_value reaches 
Or you can make a simulation for the future weeks and months to see
if the simulation is accurate compared to the current data gathered
